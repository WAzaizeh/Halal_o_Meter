VISwpz_sdcgN04k1SuC0yw,"This place is pretty damn good for a quick grab n go place to eat. My wife n I are having a great meal. Must say their ""GREEN"" sauce. It's the way to go. Kinda like a ""Halal"" white sauce. Put it on everything! I must say that the food is definitely pretty good. I have only had one bad meal at this place which did not get addressed in a very good way. I am not the type to get into a yelling match but this one was close. It seems that I put a kink in their manufacturing chain by not liking my meal and they acted as though I was the first person to ever complain about the taste. Lets be serious...anyone could make a mistake and that day it was definitely their bad.

I would have given the place 4 stars but I hate the fact that you get rushed out of this place. They should just expand the place instead of walking up to you and taking your half eaten dish and saying finished. If I am waiting 20 minutes to get a seat I don't expect to only eat for 15 minutes and run. That has happened over and over again at this place but the food is good enough to keep me coming and $9.75 for a good sized meal with a drink is not that bad for midtown. I could do better with the Halal guy down the street but sometimes you just want to give in and eat at Sophie's.

I resentfully go back to this place about 20 times a year and I am pretty sure that won't change."
USQxn9Arz6tl-4AqtqpCkg,"holy crap! Best lamb gyro i ever had in my life. HANDS DOWN!  

I heard the only makes his lamb fresh every morning - not like that halal lamb you see on the carts.  This stuff is LEGITTTT In some respects I am short changing this place. I got a lamb and beef pita sandwich and it was a perfectly okay sandwich which I basically enjoyed eating. The tzatziki was pretty good, though poorly distributed through the sandwich. The meat was probably the sandwich's weakest point, pretty dry and stringy, though reasonably well flavored.

The reason this place only gets two stars is because I could have walked around the corner and gone to ANY Halal truck and gotten a superior version of basically the same sandwich for $3-6. The meat would have been more moist and there might have even been a great diversity of vegetables. The Pita Press pita sandwich, on the other hand, costs over $8 and is not without its flaws.

Skip this place and support our street vendors instead. They make better sandwiches for much less money. I had the beef/lamb platter with beans. The woman in front wasn't very nice. The salad which accompanied it was fine though the dressing lacked some flavor. The pita was a little cool. I mean I don't mind having generic pita but at least heat it. In terms of the meat, it was actually pretty good. There was a good mix of fat and flavor. The side that came with it, the beans/gigantes, were OK. It had a light tomato sauce which didn't add much but at least the beans were soft.

I might go back but this area has a ton of halal carts with much cheaper food with better service also. I'll go back when I am in the mood for something sweet or for their (pricey but delicious) sour cherry soda. 2.5 Great place if you like to wait in long lines with yuppies who don't know what real Greek food is. I paid almost $8 with tax for a pita Bfteki sandwich and I gave it 3 stars because it was tasty but also because it was unfulfilling; I'm not a model, I'm 5'9"" 180lb, however, when I order a kabab I want a kabab NOT two large strips of MEATLOAF which this was. I felt ripped off because they use too much wheat in the ""kebab."" There was also barely any lettuce and onion in it.

This is the typical service you get from a hyped up hip yuppy magnet restaurant. I'd go back to give it another chance but I'm not going to pay over $10 for a Greek salad with chicken when the halal carts have better and cheaper food than this. Perfectly fine option for guaranteed lean meat, partially bio-degradable containers, healthier Greek eats, and consistently good customer service.   I have co-workers who order from PP religiously.  We just did office catering and PP was accommodating to our needs, plus I received no complaints (no wows, but everyone satiated).  So you may find your match for personal or Greek catering needs here.  

Howsomever, for this guy, while I'd eat it again on someone else's dime, I'd probably get a salad or the fritters (opposed to the lamb & beef rotisserie I ordered).  

Why?  When it comes to my drachmas, I prefer more aggressive seasoning and juicier meats for my Greek grub, especially at this price point.  So I'd choose a quality halal cart or top-notch upscale Greek over Pita Press.

HUGE CAVEAT: Not to sound like ""that guy"", but to be fair - I've been an Astorian for about the past half decade, was going there for Greek food well before I became a resident, have had very successful Greek chefs as friends, and have been to some of the most renowned Greek eateries in the country.  All that ish makes for a pretty significant bias when it comes to this cuisine.  If you don't have that kind of bias going on, give 'em a whirl!  

LAST BITES: Good customer service can be hard to find, and you're spending about the same as you'd spend at Dig Inn, and skipping the grease of the street meat carts.  10% off when you place your first order directly through their website.  So could be worth givin' 'em a whirl."
j9TdOBSQ1LRw8v3hW5fObQ,"My bf and I had the Fried Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Catfish, Salad and a piece of Apple Pie.
Catfish-Delicious!
Mac & Cheese-Good
Salad-Good
Apple Pie- A MUST!!! Coming back for this one!!!!
Fried Chicken-Ehh, no flavor, crispy skin though, small pieces. Overpriced.

Overall  IF I come back, it will be for the Catfish & the Apple Pie or to try out any other deserts they have. Hands down the best fried chicken I've had so far is Darbars Halal Fried Chicken. Guilty pleasures ahoy!
I'll admit I don't eat a ton of fried chicken aside from Popeyes and random halal fried chicken places occasionally (its not something on the menu at home). But that made Pies 'N' Thighs that much better.
I came here with 6 other friends prepared to get extremely fat. I got myself a fried chicken box (picked the mac and cheese as a side). Some others got the superbowl, the insane burger, etc. I also ordered a slice of key lime pie. I wasn't expecting the hot sauce in the mac and cheese, but it was a nice twist. The chicken was also really really well made.
Overall delicious food. They're not so good at service though, and can take a while to get your food. Hopefully that will improve some time soon. Where do I begin...

I went to Pies 'n' Thighs because a friend recommended it (not sure if she'll be a friend after that experience)... We went on Tuesday, July 27th.  When I walked in, I was disturbed by the decor.  It looked like a late 70's early 80's garage sale gone wrong.  Mix matched chairs and tables, which looked extremely dirty as opposed to vintage which I think is what they were going for.  Anyway, since the food recommendation was good, I decided to give it a try anyway... BIG MISTAKE...

The waitress who looked like she just rolled out of bed in her dingy tank top, dirty converse sneakers and head full of dripping sweat was a complete turn off.  She was nice though.  She gave us all glasses of water, but to my surprise, the cup was dirty because the water looked to have grease floating on top. Again, another sign that I should leave, but I didnt.  I ordered the chicken box, which comes w/ 3 pieces of chicken, a biscuit and 1 side. HA! I asked for a breast, leg and wing.  What I received, i'm not sure.  The only piece that I was able to identify was a thigh (thus the name pies n thighs I guess).  The chicken was disgusting... and luke warm @ best. I mean for a small establishment, such as this, you would think that you could get fresh out of the oil hot fried chicken. I could have gotten fresher, tastier fried chicken at the local halal chicken spot.  Hell I could have gotten better fried chicken at the local chinese restaurant.  The biscuit that I received was COLD, HARD and UNAPPEALING! The collard greens, were a scam, nothing southern about them, and there was hot sauce poured all over them, which I did not ask for.  My friends Mac and cheese had hot sauce poured all over it as well, maybe they put the hot sauce on to mask the bad taste.  Who knows.  However, even with the bad food, there was one highlight.... THE LEMONADE!!! Yummy and refreshing.  I was tempted to try the pies, to see if there would be a saving grace for this place, but they all looked super stale and definitely not appetizing.  All in all, I spent $15 and went home hungry and with an aching belly.  This place does not scream ""southern cuisine"" and if all you're looking for is some good fried chicken, take your $11 and go to Popeye's where you can get 10 pcs of hot, tasty fried chicken for $10.99."
ZrdTKStTAo2pchslOev1KQ,"I've been here three times and every time I've been super satisfied. Their Tiffin Wallah set is filling and awesome! The dosas are great ( though I have soft spot for Saravana Bhavan)- their pakoras are the best fried happiness. The staff is super nice- its Kosher! Vegetarian! I came with a group that included vegan, halal, kosher friends- all happy. I probably have had better Indian food but, considering the small price, this has to have been my favorite meal in quite some time.
Feeling confident, we ordered the $14 sampler meals that is a stunning amount of food all brought to you at one time. For the one price you get 3 curries, two chutneys, rice, breads, and dessert. Amazing. There were 3 versions of these themed meals and we had 2 are both were worthy of praise with the breads being especially fresh.
With our favorite Halal truck nowhere to be seen the next night, we returned to Tiffin Wallah. Bouyed by the evident popularity of the crepe-like dosas with our fellow diners the previous night, I ordered one and it was a grand affair. About the size of an XL pizza skin folded into quarters it had curry tucked inside and excellent dipping sauces. I couldn't stop.
I would call the service attentive but I did not fell rushed. In fact, we stayed in our seats rather easily although it was not crowded. I enjoyed the mood in the place as it was far from the frantic pace of the life outside."
34zyzLqKbwSqCnF2vMtIRA,"This is definitely a savior for the Columbia U students and staff who are limited to the usual barrage of  Halal trucks and standard counter delis.  Frites 'n' Meats comes to town once a week for lunch and we at CU are glad to have them.

The burgers are great quality and are made to order (as long as you provide your superhero name) and the frites are the best within the one mile radius.  Be sure to try their burgers of the week and grab some garlic aioli for the frites.  

This truck is going to be a solid competitor for the new 5-Guys slated to open a mere five blocks away. Be sure to bring your hole punched card when you go back so you can earn yourself a free burger! literally just finished my angus burger.

the guys in the truck were friendly and we chatted about various burgers in the city. awesome guys, but back to the meat of the story.

i got an angus burger (medium rare) with applewood smoked bacon, Gruyère cheese, and the typical toppings of onion, tomato, lettuce. when it comes down to a burger, its all about the meat. it is its time to shine. the patty in my burger was good, but not great. even though it was supposed to be medium rare, it was well done all around the outsides. it was medium near the center of the patty. because of this, i believe it be become drier than it should have been for a medium rare burger. it was a bit charred, but not too bad that it would cover the flavor of the meat.

the fries, were not salty at all. i guess someone read the yelp reviews and cut back on the salt. but as god as my witness, i could have sworn these were mcdonald fries. it had the same shape and texture. it was very similar to McDonalds. even though, they were very good. i could eat a bucket of them. i got the sun dried tomato aioli which was awesome. the garlic aioli was fantastic. if you love garlic, you will love the aioli.  

all in all, it was a good burger. the only thing that would have made it a GREAT burger was if it was less well done and more medium to medium rare.

this is a great addition to the neighborhood filled with halal meat carts and hot dog vendors. i will definitely be back!"
HY2TVTqRB_Z_kYCBa7NO9w,"This place has been revived since ownership has changed.
I have been going here for 20years. Great local spot for a slice and pies for parties.
Now they have great burgers and Maybe the best Halal in the bronx! Great service, friendly staff, and great FOOD!
These guys make custom burgers, custom pizza slices, omlettes, smoothies, salads and halal food at great prices. Best option in the area in my opinion."
awxuFWRMamhQGenCwg7cSQ,"Walked in, the lady took my order 1 pork gyro without onions and 1 chicken gyro without onions or tomatoes. She takes my card for purchase. Comes back and tosses receipt and pen on the counter. A little rude, but whatever. Dude in kitchen makes pork gyro first. All good. He then makes my chicken gyro and throws a bunch of onions on the pita. I say ""I said no onions"". The girl then starts accusing me of saying I said ""extra onions"". It was back and forth of who said and who heard what. It was dumb. The guy making gyros shuts her up finally and grabs a new pita bread. Mind you I walked in knowing their letter grade was pending. I didn't even have to step in. I only came because I saw them featured on a local nyc tv show. The food was eh. Large portions, but kinda bland. You'll have to doctor it up at home if you get take out like me. Nothing amazing. The Halal Guys is much better with lots of flavor. Have been intrigued by the overwhelming popularity this place for quite some time. Went in last night and ordered chicken Gyro over rice platter (comes with a small side salad and two slices of pita).

I won't insult them by comparing it to halal cart at $6 because BZ is offering a much different level of quality . However - perhaps $12 would be more appropriate plus / minus drink. Roadside grill food truck under the train has an excellent chicken gyro platter (includes GREEK salad and rice ) for $9 and is just as good. Souvlaki guy cart under train has excellent quality pork souvlaki , well dressed , for $3 / stick.

The quality of the meat was OK and the people are friendly but I'm just floored by how expensive this was at $19.50 - no drink. the portion size was decent but....it's chicken over rice.  That is simply an incredible rip off - will never come back . I take my gyros seriously. I would even consider myself a gyro connoisseur, on the perpetual quest to find a restaurant on par with the city's halal carts.

Well look no further! After many failed attempts from nearby Astorian Greek restaurants (a lot of which were surprisingly gyro-less on their menus), I have found the perfectly stuffed pita with the most delectable gyro meat. I've had their gyros delivered many times, and even ate in once. Although the service is slightly slow, the staff is extremely friendly. My friend and I drank a few beers and nibbled on the Greek fries, so we didn't mind the wait at all.

Also, don't forget to try the platters! Once my boyfriend and I ordered the mix for two, and I don't think words can describe how delicious everything was (not to mention how huge the portion was). The vegetable platter is my favorite though, with the grilled haloumi and sautéed veggies. I recently moved to Astoria and this place happens to be near so I tried based on yelp review their famous pork gyro.  First time was amazing with juicy tender meats.  So I started getting them every other day.  I can tell you that I had the same thing at least 7 times so far. Unfortunately each time the amount of uneatable pork meat portion becomes larger and larger.  My last pork gyro had almost 1/2 of meats so thick, old,  and tough I had to throw all them out. I thought maybe it's just the color or the way meat looks so I actually physically tried to chew them.  Absolutely no chance of eating them.  I have included picture to prove it.  And mind you this is not the first time.  For the first few,  I gave them benefit of doubt.  Maybe the chef is subsitite,  maybe they had bad pork meat today.  But no EVERY SINGLE TIME I orders (so far 7 almost every or every other day)  it gets worse and worse.  Even 5 dollar halal cart gives me more quality meal than this

Another point?  Their pork gyro is $8.50 first few times I got charged exactly $8.50 until one Halloween night I was charged $9.25 and today was also $9.25. I pay cash all the time.  So it's sometimes $9.25 and sometimes $8.50? their lunch set is $10.00 and I got it only 3 times so far for exactly $10.00 Idk one day it will be $11? $12? At randome times? This adds to their shaydiness of their business.  And their crew is consistent,  a white girl and a skinny white guy and a muscular white guy are regular cashier/waiter/owners.  All the time.  So it can't be a newbies mistake.  So in the end,  I advise you if you want to get a meal that is cut in half than it's supposed to be and takes a while to eat it because you have to take out bad meats in order to chew the good ones while getting charged random prices for the sandwich , go ahead.  This place look so cheap and shady and it is unfortunate because it's nearby but no thank you I'm heading to subway instead,  and I believe I gave them fair opportunities before I write my review"
Wm2HlpBm6naywFQdsezUew,"Stopped in while I waited for a friend to get off work around lunch time. Walked in while on the phone, and assumed it was the chain of ""halal guys"". Unlike Halal guys, the food taste great! Personally, for my taste halal guys is bland, and the meat is not seasoned well, and the hot sauce is just too much. Here at Off The grill, the food tastes clean, well seasoned and the sauce does not overwhelm the food.

The location is prestige! Clean! Spotless! Looks as though they opened prior to me walking in. The staff are so friendly and polite, and you get a genuine smile, which is rare.

I came in around lunch time, was not so busy, but, I could see other professionals were dining in as well. I will definitely be back! I don't like it at all. Grabbed two chicken platters, was so excited but all the excitement lost at once when I tasted it. Chicken was not cooked well, so hard to chew and rice was the same, not fully cooked, The only two stars I am giving because of there customer service and way of talking in so polite manner, that's it, but if we talk about food, I don't like it, Juicy Platters and Halal guys are much better. So guys please improve your cooking skills, thanks. Please beware!!! This place says it's ""halal style"" on the website but its actually not halal! We went there for lunch and asked the owner to make sure, he said it's just ""halal style"" but the meat and chicken are just ""normal"" not halal. I had the chicken platter and a side of falafel. This is the best halal food I've ever had, everything was so fresh and  tasty. The place is clean and modern but obviously tables were put on the side due to Covid-19 restrictions.  The gentleman at the counter was polite and the prices are very reasonable.
There's plenty of parking since it's located at the Richfield shopping center. Anyway, I really recommend this restaurant; give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. Place is great if you want a nice platter like the halal guys. Always fresh and always clean. The workers are very helpful and always in a nice mood. So, Ive been going to Off the Grill for sometime now, my local go to when I am craving chicken and lamb platters or salad, it being one of the closest in taste to the original Halal Guys, even though they are a bit pricey.  

However, seems with the current Covid-19 crisis, their deliveries have taken a very noticeable dip in service.  Much smaller portions where they are no where near as big as they used to be, prices for delivery through the roof, and the food arriving cold, needing to be reheated (which is odd since the delivery arrived on time as expected, so assuming it was cold when it left).  We ordered falafel as well which came cold and soggy, reinforcing my theory of not cooked / reheated nearly enough prior to being picked up (or was it just sitting out for a while waiting for an order?)

I'd normally give 2 stars as the actual seasoning of the food is pretty close to being on point, it just the price, obvious shrinkage in size, and it being cold when delivered was just enough to drop them down to 1 star...  Hope they see this and address it. This place is bangin...I've had pretty much everything on their menu and I've never been disappointed. Kebab meat is so flavorful and everything is made fresh, pitas are so delicious and soft. I never really liked halal food until I tried this place. I've been here a total of 3 times and the first 2 were great I was so happy a place like this opened up close to the area but the 3rd and final time I ordered 3 platters on Uber Eats to my work and as I was eating it I found beard hair in my platter. I was so disgusted because it wasn't just 1. There were a few. I was so disappointed because I wanted to like this place but after contacting Uber eats and my bank they refunded me for my order but kept reversing the claim. I've given up on this place and how they handle situations with unsanitary food. It's really a shame and gross. I'll be sticking to Halal Guys who has never let me down. Hungry for a quick lunch after watching movie at Clifton AMC..came across this place and gave it a shot. Hit the spot for a halal craving, quality food for a fair price. Steady flow of customers getting take out as we enjoyed our meal in the clean dining area. Staff/owner(?) was very friendly. Would definitely come by again for my gyro or chicken and rice fix. Thanks! Came to this place on a weekday night. It's a casual spot and it's kept super clean and nice. I ate in at this place, but lots of people came by and grabbed takeout. I was really pleased with the staff and how fast the food was prepared.

I got the combo platter which is what I usually get at my go to places like The Halal Guys in the city. It tasted good and cost $9 and had plenty leftover! The food is immaculate. Could not be better. Much better than Juicy Platters or Halal Guys. Stopped in after a long time of driving past it. Must say it was pretty good. Better than I expected to be honest. Better than the chain of halal guys that have come into NJ. Hot sauce is hot, so if you're not too into it either get only 1 line or no hot sauce. I didn't mind that I was sweating because I got 2 lines of hot sauce.  Everything tasted pretty fresh and fair priced. Yum! Saw this place randomly and thought why not. I've always liked halal/Mediterranean food and this place did not disappoint. This place was completely empty when I was there and I had a chance to meet the owner who was very nice.

I had the combo of chicken and lamb over rice and it was delicious and fresh. Price was higher than what I usually pay in NYC for halal food but the food here was slightly fresher and higher quality.

Overall this will be my go to spot for halal/Mediterranean food if I'm in the area. I sincerely hope they do well and stay This was very tasty. Much better than Halal Guys. Got the combo, portion was huge and under 10 bucks. Can't go wrong with that. Clean restaurant. Owner was nice. Not a big fan of the diamond plate decoration but it's the food that matters. Far away from the city, had to fulfill my gyro craving. This place popped up on Yelp and I decided to give it a try. I mean, what could go wrong with chicken, rice and salad.
Contrary to my low expectations, this place was excellent. The staff were courteous and friendly and offered some extras too as it was our first time in the area. We ordered the chicken platter and one mixed platter (chicken and beef mixed with lamb). The salad was fresh and crunchy, unlike some other gyro places I tried. The sauces on the side were excellent. The red sauce isn't as spicy as the Halal guys sauce, but did the job for my strong Indian palate.
We briefly met the owner who would make it a point to come check on all his customers. He seemed like a passionate man, who loved doing what he did. Wonderful attitude.
I genuinely enjoyed my dinner and will definitely return!"
zMV3am6rEoP43jLeHvzUeA,"I pass them nearly every night, and I admire them for their presence adding a little variety to the late-night food truck scene behind halal carts and tacos.  Finally gave them a try, though, and was woefully underwhelmed.  I was handed a chargrilled heap - black from the griddle and tasting of smoke more than anything else.

You get sour cream on top, but it's doled out from a dressing bottle in a conservative fashion that hardly covers the large portion size.  

It's cool they're made to order, and I get that all of this is maybe just their ""style,"" but don't come expecting this to be a convenient Westside answer to Veselka.  It's not. Wow is all I can say. I've never had Russian dumplings before and I never thought they would be so flavorful. I got the chicken teriyaki special which are basically chicken dumplings with chives and sesame seeds. The dumplings were pan fried so they aren't soggy, and each bite is bursting with juicy flavor. For $7 it really is a deal, especially given the shitty and overpriced food options in the area.

I've had my fair share of dumplings, but the next time I'm in the mood I know where I'll be going.

Bonus star for the design of the cart which is much more interesting than the other halal and got dog carts throughout the city."
ZouH4imW3QVxCgq4zy3QRA,"No more Sabrett hot dogs in NYC as we knew it long time ago... All the hot dog stands have been taken over by Halal Food owners (which is fine, but), and the hot dog tastes terrible, and the onion sauce isn't the same. So psst. I went to New York with misplaced idea of how delicious the street dogs would be.  I feel like i was lied to by popular culture.  Those things are below average at best and lead to a not so good feeling inside your belly.  Thank god for all the halal food trucks or I would have starved."
TVqGgXmNH8wPZpHX-GWD4g,"The burgers are so good and they use Halal beef. Great place for a quick bite. Definitely under rated due to unreal expectations. Had a cheeseburger, fries, coke. At first it looked dry, but when I bit into it the flavor was delicious. It's not a fancy place, but it is a step up from the fried chicken joints. I'm such a fatty I almost ordered another burger. Halal = better quality meat. Also the cashier was mysterious and hot and sweet. Heyyyyyy. What drew me into this place besides having a few drinks in me was that it's halal and I equate halal food with freshness, so here goes...

1. Fried Chicken - juicy, moist, crispy skin - what more can you ask for of your fried brethren
2. Biscuits - little grainy but not overly sweet; good for slathering on some honey or dunking in gravy
3. Side of veggies - boiled, overcooked and bland :/

Haven't tried anything else yet on their menu and chances are I won't if I want to stick to not particularly eating fried food but a girl can dream...

""Fried chicken just tend to make you feel better about life."" Crown Friend Chicken is beta and Chubby's is 2.0.  Its just a step above the ghetto fried chicken places that I go to in Brooklyn if not the same thing.  The only difference they have kabab.  Place basically serves frozen food just like any other fast food place except some items are halal.  

Place is definitely over-hyped !

You will get a good meal don't get me wrong but its nothing out of the ordinary.  I can make this stuff at home. Having picked up a menu ahead of time, i finally decided to grab some food and check the place out.  From the menu, I knew or should I say, I hoped for food above the regular fast-food chain quality, unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Grabbing food for a few people, I ordered the 5oz burger, 10oz burger chubby burger with cheese (asked for mushroom, jalapeño, fried onion additions), 2 spicy chicken sandwiches, beef cheesesteak, and side orders of corn and onion rings.  
Unfortunately, both chicken sandwiches were not in the order but was charged and yes I should have checked before leaving.  Surprisingly, the 5oz burger was par at best, however the chubby burger (again, minus the additional asked choices) still appeared to be more flavorful and felt worth the paid price.  The cheesesteak on the other hand was decent and something I could recommend for others to try without hesitation.

Yes the venue is Halal and a good option for the strictly halal patrons, but for all others, it is just an option with other locales in the neighborhood. It is a fast food, halal chicken spot. The food is good and fulfilling and the staff is very friendly. I always ask for a double grilled chicken sandwich or a platter for my post-workout meal. The only reason this place is undeserving of the 5th star is not because of the service, food or cleanliness- It is the quality of people that pour into this joint from the next door nightclub/lounge. If you go after 10 PM, you'll see a fair share of drunk, obnoxious, ghetto and trashy folks acting like a bunch of juvenile delinquents. Nonetheless, this is still a fun place to eat. Food was good ordered the hot wings and fries a burger and chicken and rice plate that comes with a salad.
Loved my wings and fries exactly what I wanted the chicken and rice is like halal style / tasting so ok . And burger was ok. But I'm not a huge burger fan . It did what it needed to do . 3 stars on the food
2. Missing bc inside was like gross and dirty the tables needed to be wiped the floor moped  the chairs wiped it looked sticky and a layer of dirt just a good clean down over all. I didn't want to sit down to eat but I was so hungry couldn't wait . The surroundings was so ew
My chicken was though hot juicy and good flavor . Go if you must in a rush quick fast food bite but not your regular run to stop. I really think this place was a solid two star since ""I've had better"" but I decided to give it a three because it is halal and I think it's good that they are able to give burgers, fries and fried chicken to people with dietary needs.  Everyone deserves to have some fatty food sometimes! I asked the guy working there how long the place has been open and he said two months.  So it is brand new.  Maybe they will get better!

Below are the foods I tried:
-Fried chicken: Nice and crispy but the coating was not enough.  The chicken was also very dry and did not have enough seasoning.
-5 oz cheeseburger: It had american cheese, mayo, ketchup and other standard burger toppings.  The patty itself was bland (like the chicken).  It need much more flavor and it was also very dry.
-Mac&Cheese: Good! But nothing special.
-Mashed Potatoes: A little strange.  They were mashed potato balls swimming in gravy.
-French Fries: Nothing special but fine.

Maybe I'll give them a try again in a few months and see how they are! These guys are a great fast food alternative that's actually halal. The spicy chicken sandwich reminds me of the Wendy's one before I reverted. And sometimes on good days their fries are awesome. But, the service is kinda shoddy. A handful of times they have messed up our orders by either forgetting item orders completely or parts of the meals. The most recent experience tipped me over the edge to actually write this. My wife likes to get their 6 or 10 pc. Chicken meal. This time on a 10 pc. order, there were only 8. It's happened before in the past where 1 or 2 were missing but usually we just brushed it off, but since this is a recurring thing my wife decided to call them out on it. The associate on the phone said they don't count when they pick the chicken. Well, why not? If that's the case they shouldn't have a specific number on the menu. List the menu item by weight or size (ex. s, m, l) if you have an issue with counting how many you put in the box. When the delivery guy came with the apologetic replacement item he asked what had happened. I couldn't fully understand what he was saying but it felt like he got defensive and was insinuating that we were lying, since ""I've been delivering for months now.""? And ""It's been 2 hours since I last came.""? I don't really know what he was talking about because this was at 6:40ish and the orginal order came at 5:35 just before I had to walk our dog. So lesson learned don't order delivery from here often because the likelihood of a screw up is just a little too high. If your a muslim in the neighborhood craving fast food it's an ok place (and only option, sadly) to just pop in."
MQTiDKvuKFobyaHjdbDmnA,"Went here to grab some halal food with my siblings. We went on a friday night and it was completely empty. I ordered a #6 that came with 8 piece BBQ wings, fries and a fountain drink. My sister accidentally ordered the wrong sandwich and after arriving the guy generously offered to remake the order and allowed us to keep the sandwich. service was really fast and the workers are extremely polite. definitely recommend going there for a quick grab . I have tried their plain cheese on several occasions and never been disappointed.
Ventured out to try their veggie one recently.. what a disaster! It was as if they dumped shop rite's produce section on a 14 inch pie...yuck. the pie was super soggy, and wasn't even ready on time! The guy who took my order realized 15 mins later that he hadn't send the slip of paper on to the back.. ugh. Worse: no apology, no recognition of his mistake.
Garlic knots were like doughy asteroids shot up from the caverns of hell. Absolutely no taste of garlic. Just big, hard... balls... *ahem*.
Im happy to say though that the kettle cooked potato chips were fantastic!!
Never going back to panatieri.. I recommend stelton pizzeria, rose's pizza & halal, and target's archer farms pizzas."
tsHdT1GDibhYYA0JA7Z9tg,"i caught wind of this place just becuase i was sorta over Halal combo and rice. Since it was just a few blocks down the street from my hotel, i went on ahead and gave it a go.

The place is pretty new york city no none sense joint. There are shelf tables that go around the whole space. Makes sense, only way to maximize space for dine-in patrons.

Lets do the food i ordered shall we.

Spicy and Sour Spinach Dumpling Soup:     This was definitely some destructive stuff. If i was to go vegan, this would definitely be my go to dish.

Spicy Cumin Lamb:     I was totally not ready for how good this dish is. The noodles, the meat and the broth is just dimentia inducing. Make sure you're an expert chopstick handler because these noodles seem to go on forever and ever and ever. I'd totally order this one again.

Im in love with this spot and I definitely can't wait for my next chance to have another crack at a different menu item. Move over Halal Guys, I think I have a new favorite.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!! Why can't we have excellent Chinese food in San Francisco like this?  If they can franchise the Halal Guys, they can franchise Xi'an Famous Foods, and bring their delectables to San Francisco.

I only had an opportunity to try their oxtail and noodles dish, and I really enjoyed it.  Rather, I really really loved their noodles!  The texture, the thick width, and the taste of the dish overall.  I know there are a plethora of delicious noodle spots all over NYC and Flushing, which I'm sure are even better in quality.  However, for a fast-food like joint in a decent setting, I found it quite pleasing.  

Everyone talks about these dishes as being super spicy and hot, but you can choose from a range of spiciness, from no spice to very spicy.  I chose spicy, which was similar to a medium spicy, and found it came out exactly as I had expected.  

Although $13,00 and some odd change isn't expensive for a meal, especially in the heart of Midtown, the actual serving size was, smaller than you would expect at a traditional sit-down restaurant.  I got two small pieces of oxtails, and though I didn't leave hungry, I definitely could've used some more noodles.  

There are a bunch of locations throughout the NYC area, so I'm not sure if these locations are franchised or branch offshoots, but the seating area in this location seemed cleaner and more inviting than the one I passed and looked into on W. 45th.  

P.S.  Anthony Bourdain helped put these guys on the map. Thank you, Anthony!"
ekkWZSUhRkmQwRdoXso9iA,"Ok 1. Don't know why patty shack has only 3.5 stars. I've been here three times and everything is fantastic! 2. I love that their beef is halal too - you can tell the meat is clean. 3. I've dined in and ordered out via yelp and always had the best service. They are organized, clean, and quick! Great experience and I haven't even stepped into this restaurant yet. I had a few questions regarding the meat in they use and the Owner Adam T. responded very quickly and was very friendly and provided me with the answers I was looking for. I look forward to going to The Patty Shack and trying some Awesome food soon. Thank you Adam for being so helpful!!!

To anyone looking for Halal meat information, Adam was able to let me know that the meat used is supplied from Creekstone Farms and the beef and chicken that are used are Halal Certified!!!!! This is a great burger option for those who only eat halal meat all of their beef is halal. I ordered the Forget About It burger without the bacon, an order of fries, and an Oreo shake. The review of the burger itself is 5/5, it was cooked medium and tasted fresh. I took the order to go, but the inside has plenty of seating space if you want to eat there. There's a few parking spots outside and a couple of parking lots on the side. The fries were about average. The Oreo shake was disappointing. The total for all three items was around $23 which is absurd. The food was good, but it's tough to understand how expensive things in the Bay Area have gotten when only a burger, fries, and a shake is over $20. Overall it was a pleasant experience and the customer service was quick and friendly. The price would be a barrier for me going back. It's Halal and it's the best burger I ever had. The bun, patty , jalapeño, grilled onion ... Amazing!"
k_ps7pFNTE48MIm23vg87w,"This place misrepresents itself claiming it serves halal food. After I asked the server what was Halal on the Menu and what was not, she stated besides pork (meatballs), everything else was Halal. Not only it's an uneducated statement from someone who clearly doesn't know the definition of Halal, it is deceptive. I informed her that just because it's not pork it doesn't become Halal, and requested to see a Halal certificate which should be displayed in any Halal restaurant.

This place deceives Halal eaters by claiming it's a Halal place when it's not. Their claim that anything besides pork is Halal is a misrepresentation and untrue. Places like this should be penalized. Finally a full service halal restaurant inside Roosevelt field mall! It's about damn time! Located on the 2nd floor by the Macy's parking garage.
Hands on service, as all the servers were on point and very helpful.
They have everything from pizza, paninis, wraps, to very delicious main courses consisting of chicken, steak, fish.
The chocolate cake with scoop of ice cream was the highlight at the end of the night though! Very delicious and fresh! Definitely will be back to try out all the other options!"
2OZj0s8obtFvVYoC2_OgTA,"Way better then Halal Guy in NY. Better quality and fast delivery. Unfortunately today is the last day of my business trip. If I come again this area, I will order the food from this place again. Thanks Fresh Halal food and very friendly service reasonable prices.definitely recommend this place. halal chicken... enough said. Will NEVER eat that brutally killed food again i was forced to give a star rating but it deserves NOTHING. Go CHICKEN GALORE in Woodbrige instead. WAY BETTER"
Hjki9whBg22VNnvlnrrElQ,"I give this restaurant no stars their rude the owner himself is a jerk and the food they claim to have halal but the hamburger taste like store bought burgers. I believe they  lied about carrying halal food.i eat halal meat and food products and halal meat has a different taste compared to non-halal meat.i have been ordering from everett pizza place for the last 7 months and every time I have order from them they have messed up my order and when they have a special they lie about it one week I order a special they allowed me to make some changes to it and I've been ordering it like that for 5 months all the sudden they claim to never had they do the special the way I ordered it.they did that with another special again today when I asked to speak to the owner regarding their constant change in their store he  refused to speak and said out loudly she doesn't like the way I do my business she can take her stupid business else where and the cashier hung up the phone.i would never recommend this restaurant to anyone they lie alot and the owner is  a jerk.the food is also over cooked and burned all the time. Everett pizza place in everett, mass,02149. I was first introduced to this place by a friend of mine a few weeks ago for the first time. The food is mediocre  and no different from nick's or Royal in East Boston but I was attracted to this place after my first encounter because they claim to serve halal food. Fast toward to my last order, the delivery driver came unprepared without a pen and asked me to find a pen to sign the receipt. I went on a scavenger hunt for a pen in my house and some how misplaced the receipt during the search. After spending 5-10 minutes looking around everywhere For the receipt, I apologized to the driver and told him I can't find the receipt and even asked if I should call his employer to explain to him about this whole bizarre receipt situation but he replied ""no it's okay"" I called to place an order today and Whomever answered the phone was so rude and said they will not deliver to my number. When I asked why, they said I refused to sign the receipt and gave the driver a hard time. I tried explaining what happened that day but the person on the phone was so rude and unprofessional and kept insisting that all ""their drivers carry a pen!"" I had no reason to not sign a stupid receipt and they didn't have to be so rude and hang up on me over an innocent mistake. I will never order from this place and I'll make sure everyone I know doesn't either!"
cOk43K9MNNwePZo2hjsBxQ,"This is the go to place for fresh bowls of goodness in the area. You are greeted by cool machines which makes these bowls.  Priced reasonable and a big helping as well. I tried the Mediterranean bowl and it was just great! It reminds of the bowls from Halal guys and that's a good thing. How to order food at Spyce like a PRO!

Welcome to the new robotic restaurant, where most things are automated.

1. Line up to order your food at a kiosk. There are paper menus floating around.
2. Pick the kind of bowl you want- regular, vegan etc. My personal favorite is the latin bowl- it doesn't taste like chipotle but its delicious. I also like the chicken and rice bowl, it come with white sauce that tastes like the Halal guy's white sauce.
3. Customize- only ingredients listed in bold can be REMOVED. Remember, if you remove the ingredients, there are no free replacements. You can ADD other toppings but at a cost.
#TIP: If you want to go low carb and remove the grains, the quantity of food will be greatly reduced. And no, you can't make it a salad bowl. You simply get the food minus the grains = less food.
4. Pay for your food. You can use a credit card. You can also pay with cash but you would have to go to a human worker to pay with cash.
5. Get your receipt and wait. You can have the receipt sent to your phone too.
6. Your name will appear on on of the machines. The machine will cook your food. Then a human will add the cold toppings, put a sticker with your name on your bowl and call your name.
7. Collect your bowl and eat!

Other tips:
-You can buy drinks as well.
-There are water cups on top of the soda machine.
-There is limited seating. It gets super crowded during lunch so I would recommend eating elsewhere."
359aBfrDilLaF_gbSdy-wg,"Really delicious food and extremely friendly service! Will definitely come back!
We ordered the thai red curry, cashew fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, thai chicken wings, crab rangoon and chicken wontons and everything was yummy! The best part is everything chicken is Halal! We stopped by here for lunch on a weekday afternoon. The place was fairly clean and nicely decorated. It was also empty, so service was quick. It seemed to be a family owned restaurant and our waitress was very friendly and stopped by often to check on us and refill our water glasses. We received our food within 10-15 minutes of ordering.

This restaurant serves halal chicken. I ordered the Spicy Green Curry w/ chicken which I ordered with white rice. The curry was spicy and flavorful with plenty of chicken pieces instead of being overloaded with vegetables. The chicken pieces also didn't contain any bones. The portions were very filling, although my entire meal amounted to less than $10. Unlike most Asian restaurants, this place did not skimp on the rice! I would definitely recommend this place for someone wanting to try authentic Thai cuisine. Excellent food and the service and friendliness is excellent as well. Fried rice is delicious but do note that the hot is HOT!!! Also the chicken is zabiha/halal which is a huge plus and they're open late This place is a true hidden gem. It's small and very basic to look at but the food packs a punch. The owner is an absolute sweetheart and his wife cooks all the meals. She makes all the sauces from scratch with authentic Thai ingredients. Our favorite was the sap sap wings, what amazing flavor! The green curry was delicious along with the basil chicken and lard nar.
All the chicken is halal which is what drew is to this place. Will definitely go back. In short,  great food and amazing customer service!

I have been here a few times. They serve halal chicken. Food is delicious and authentic. First time tried their most spicy, then had to go with medium level of spiciness. Food is flavorful and the service is amazing. Everytime we go, service is subpar. Last visit it was extremely busy and they were running somewhat behind (no big deal), they served us a complimentary appetizer to accommodate us. It was a unnecessary but much appreciated gesture.  As long as they keep the service and food up, I'll  be going back. Really bad food with no taste. I was highly disappointed at this place. I was really excited to find a halal Thai place in Chicago. This one really disappoints. The fried rice and egg rolls were really greasy. I felt the oil was really old that was used to fry the egg rolls and they were burned in several places. The kung pao chicken just had cabbage in it with very few prices of chicken. It was very watered down also. The only thing editable I got was the cashew fried rice. I felt sick and gross after eating at this place. Very low quality food. I had also gotten the drunken mama noodles and let me tell you they tasted as if the chief was drunk and forgot to put any spices in the food. Needless to say, I'm never coming back to this. I have never given any restaurant such a low review. This place truly deserves a bad review. I felt as if I wasted my money and time. Oh by the way, I just threw the food away. I had to make dinner. Such a horrible experience. Absolutely AMAZING!   If you are a foodie or just looking for a great place to enjoy Thai food, THIS is the place!
Upon entering,  Ziggy, the charming and incredibly  knowledgeable host/waiter, greeted us with a smile.   We instantly felt welcomed.   He explained his Thai background and the history of the restaurant.  
My group and I thought we knew Thai food, but this menu was quite extensive.  Obviously,  he knew what he was talking about when he made recommendations.  We started with Crab Rangoon and the Tom Kha soup.  Now,  I have had both of these items at other places,  but the freshness and the flavors here were off the charts!  There was a little sweetness to the Rangoon and the soup was a great marriage of flavors....lemongrass, creamy coconut milk and lime leaves.  Our generously sized lunch specials were delicious and served with homemade Thai eggrolls.  I ordered the spicy chicken eggroll.  It was filled with a wonderful mixture of chicken and veggies in a thai curry paste. Wow!!! The variety and freshness of the flavors during our meal danced on our tongues and left us wanting more!
So insanely good.....we ate here twice in one day! We stopped for lunch before we met up with friends for an event.   We told them all about the amazing experience we had at the restaurant.   Our event was over 6 hours later and knowing that Spicy Lao Thai is open until midnight,  we all decided to stop in for a snack.   Ziggy was happy to see us again and we were thrilled to be sharing such a great place with others.
Well, our ""snack"" turned into 3 appetizers and 2 entrees.....for 4 people! Of course,  Crab Rangoon was a must have!  We also took Ziggy's recommendation to try Gui Chai - a delicious pan fried dumpling made with rice flour and filled with chives. We also ordered Mee Krob Noodles - light airy noodles with a delicious tamarind sauce.   Ziggy told us when he was a little boy,  he always enjoyed going to the Thai market to get Mee Krob as a special treat.  Comments and personal stories like that made our experience even better.   I cannot stress enough how welcome we felt!
Kaew owns the restaurant with her husband.  She cooks everything and loves working with fresh ingredients!  Did I mention that all their meat is halal?  GREAT quality, but you won't find any pork here!  Now,  I like things spicy and must say that Kaew knows her spices!  Medium spiciness here is like ordering spicy at most other Thai places.   One of the most intriguing parts of the menu was the Northeast Thailand section of the menu.   Filled with wonderful curry dishes, asked for a recommendation.   The Beef Pad Tamin did not disappoint!  Ziggy divested that we order it with medium spiciness and he was right!   Yum!!!
Oh, I could go on forever about our experience.  If you have made it this far in my review...PLEASE go check this place out!  You won't be disappointed!"
DtiZhGl0gRqnCjY9_LSf4g,"I absolutely love this cart! If all my other food options suck, this Halal cart never fails. With options as low as $3, there's something for everyone. I always get the lamb - whether it's in a gyro, over rice, in a salad, or the meat by itself (always with the cucumber yogurt aka white sauce). I've never had their beans - I'm half Spanish so I don't take my beans lightly. I highly suggest a lamb gyro with onions and peppers, lettuce, tomato, white sauce and the green hot sauce. At only $4, this sandwich is beyond delicious and filling. Ask for a couple extra napkins and you'll be set. This is a review of the LARGER of the two halal carts on the NW corner of Broadway & 39th (in front of Chase). I've been a loyal customer for nearly three years now, and back in the day when it was still a small cart, it was the only cart on this corner. Things changed about a year ago when a new halal cart moved in on it's turf, and to be competitive this cart upgraded to the larger, more ""official looking"" cart you see today. When the new cart on the block moved in, it decided to park right next to the big cart and luckily for those of us who work around here, it forced the big cart to up it's game. The quality of their food drastically improved; before it was just your typical street meat, nothing special. Now they have more sauces to choose from and the salad, meat, and rice are much fresher than it used to be.

I usually get the lamb over rice or chicken over rice, and on days where I really can't decide I get half lamb half chicken. The platter comes with your choice of meat over rice, beans, and salad. A couple of times they've thrown in a falafel for free. The regular size is $5 and the small size is $4. I like that their lamb and chicken are in bite-sized pieces, not the ground up stuff that a lot of halal carts have. Since I like spicy, I always ask for extra hot sauce over my food, and they always oblige with no attitude. Very friendly and efficient service!"
cDm5x4hKe-U0eA4TRUIw2w,"This Halal truck spot is GREAT!! i love it. this is a great alternative to paying 10 dollar plus meals in the east midtown area. The line can be a little bit long but worth if if you have time to spare. they have Chicken, gyro salmon (i believe on somedays). sometimes the driver is at another location. you can get a good least expensive lunch in midtown area for under 7 bucks.. cant beat that.. def go check this out! Great Halal chicken and rice here and very friendly service. This place is different from other Halal carts in that they let you add fresh toppings. You get a good variety of extras like peppers, carrots, chickpeas, cheese, etc. all included in the price. Found the chickpea topping to be especially good. The falafel is also really good here and they put can put it in a nice piece of hero bread, too, if you like. I haven't craved halal food in a really long time. This spot is conveniently close to work and I pass by it every day so decided to try it out. It was $6.25 for my chicken over rice with pita bread. It fulfilled my craving and even made me wonder why I haven't had halal in so long when it's so delicious! Came with a salad - tomato, greens, red onions, and corn. I added white sauce too but no hot sauce for me. The two guys were really nice.

Chicken was well seasoned, tender, and just darn delicious! The salad was really good. The white sauce was amazing. I have zero things to complain about!! For me, this is another staple Midtown Lunch destination, albeit, one that I hold close to my heart (pssst! its right outside my office - don't stalk me please). At first glance, this may seem like a typical chicken and rice franchise right? WRONG. This is perhaps the best value you can get from a chicken and rice cart, actually I'm confident you get the most chicken/penny from this particular cart. This cart pretty much answers everyone's question on Rafiqi's: Are they all the same? No, not at all.  

Food: The usual suspects show up at this cart - yellow rice, chicken, lamb, lettuce, tomato, olives, cheese, corn, and peppers. Yes I get everything with white sauce. I know people are hesitant about ingesting raw materials from a food stand, but think about what you're actually eating. You're eating grilled chicken off a grill. How clean is that grill? Do you think my man, Hassam (yes that's the tall dude! ""Want a drink?""), actually scrubs that grill? No offense to him, but for a c&r cart, you need to suspend your belief that the cart would actually pass DOH standards. What you CAN count on is my boy, Hassam, to hook you up! He'll stack the rice with corn and then piece of chicken, marinated in that great halal sauce, then drizzle/deluge (paradox) the whole meal with white sauce. And for this cart, I pass on the hot sauce, which isn't hot at all. So for my white&hot lovers, you really got go to with the chimichurri-esque GREEN sauce, it has a little bit of a kick.

Wait: Get there early. Like every other chicken and rice cart, the line usually forms by 11:59. Sneak in at a little after 11:30 if you can, that's when my man, Hassam, unwrap the chicken and work the magic. It's nice to see the brown halal sauce sizzle on the hot plate or the juice drizzle from the gyro.

Value: Hassam does not skimp on the food - Not All Rafiqi's Are Created Equal. Chicken over rice is now the classic New York street food. Rafiqi's takes that formula and homogenizes an already homogenous product and scatters them all over the city, especially around the working areas. While it proves cheap, it is only middling in quality.

Rafiqi's is everywhere in Midtown, with multiple carts serving their homogenized version of chicken over rice with an oddball blend of toppings from cheese to cilantro, an uninspiring ""unique"" quality. Their food is mediocre even for street cart food standards and lacks the deliciousness that better carts like the famous 53rd and 6th Avenue Halal carts have. Their only upside is downright cheap for the amount of food you get ($5.25 for a rice platter, which is cheap for the area), proximity (for me at least), and quality control. Their homogenous version of chicken over rice ensures that across all their carts, you at least hit a minimum standard of quality unlike the wide inconsistency of other carts across the city.

While it serves mediocre food, if you're looking for some quick, cheap and filling food for the lunch rush, you could definitely do worse than Rafiqis."
oVkUJsafveXsnIBkyleMSw,"So this food truck has been here for some time now. I don't always come here but whenever I do it's almost reuniting with an old friend. These guys are super friendly and jovial, and this is really the only reason they get 4 stars. The food is the same as the average halal food truck, although they will toast your bagels (not all of them do that). When you taste the food here you won't be amazed, but the reason to come back is that you get excellent service with a smile. I guess I prefer giving my money to happy people who actually remember you and your usual order. Joe's Coffee cart is the neighborhood coffee cart by my office in NoMad (hate, hate, hate the term NoMad, sounds so yuppie!). They brew a solid cup of $1.00 coffee and an even better Iced Coffee (for for the $2.00 large, you won't regret it!) that goes nicely with one of their yummy looking morning pastries or a breakfast sandwich.

This cart is still packing a punch with the lunch crowd as they switch on over to halal food and street meat. Unless the grill is off at 1pm as has happened to me on 2 different weekdays now...so perhaps the street meat part has a, not clearly defined, schedule. I dropped a Yelp star off for this. Derp, derp, derp.

All I've ordered from here has been their regular coffee, their iced coffee, 1 egg and cheese sandwich on a roll and a singular roll with butter. All of these things were executed with with grace, finesse and were cheapsies. Thanks Joe!"
m2_ZNFos5ugAwe8ft8eaEw,"Great spot for healthy style Chinese food, love the gizzard, and soup w/ Ginger Rice.  

*Interesting note: The Chicken they use is often Halal, you must ask before dining!* This is excellent, in my opinion some of the simplest and best fast food in the world. A square meal for about $8 in NYC, served at the speed of halal cart, what more can you ask for?

And it's better than halal's salty chicken over salty rice with tons of white sauce and red sauce. Here, the quality of the meat is able to stand out in 3 different ways:

- The meat itself (duh)
- Rice (cooked with chicken broth and suffused with its essence)
- Chicken Soup (further enhanced with a spear of daikon radish)

You get all of these with your meal set and better yet if you eat in you can refill soup as many times as you like.

Sure, I am biased because I am Malaysian Chinese and eat hainanese chicken rice all the time. I am inclined to like this sort of thing. However, I do feel like this Thai version is well done and faithful to what I love, and different in ways that interest me greatly. So it's definitely a 5 star! I get intense cravings for EKMK on a daily basis. Everything here is and so well done. We got a meal set for 2, a Thai Iced Tea, and a Lychee Thai Iced Tea. The soup was a little on the salty side, but we got a free refill. The chicken was sooo good and best part about it was that it's boneless. The rice was fragrant and the drinks were tasty. Their homemade chili sauce is pretty spicy (think Halal Guys), but mixes well with the dark soy sauce. All of this for under $30 is such a steal and to top it all off, the employees are beyond friendly. I ordered their combo for two for takeout. This place seems pretty busy and looks relatively new on Broadway to me. I usually go to Taste Good Malaysian for Hainan chicken but my wife wanted to try Eim Khao for a change. The first major difference was the packaging. Both the Hainan chicken and their chicken broth flavored rice was wrapped in deli paper. When I took everything out of the bag, I asked myself what the hell did I just ordered? Cold cuts or a piece of meat from a butcher shop?

Getting past the strange paper wrap, the experience grew a little weirder. For takeout, I'm simply use to eating the rice out of the container so that I don't have to wash any bowls or plates. Eating the rice out from the deli paper was indeed a struggle. I get the whole environmental factor of not using plastic, but come on now, we're eating rice!! So onto the main event, the Hainan chicken. I'm personally not a big fan of the chicken here. It tasted very mushy to me. The texture wasn't tender at all and the way they chopped the chicken, it looked like something from a halal cart. Their sauce was okay but I prefer the zesty orange sauce from Taste Good Malaysia. On the plus side of their Hainan chicken dish, they serve the chicken heart and gizzards with it. That's a big upside since they're not letting some of the best parts of the chicken goto waste.

Verdict - A simple one and done in terms of their Hainan chicken. Perhaps I will try something else on their menu next time. The chicken was just too bland and boring. Flavorless, no zest, and perhaps even overcooked. It was a disappointing experience however, I will give them another chance in the near future."
EU34WleZFi4_hwKqv1T5dg,"One of the best steaks I have ever had. I believe I got the ny halal steak. Service is great. I believe waiter was Steve. Restaurant was nice and clean. This place is 5 stars. From the ambience, to the food, to the service.

We started off with very courteous and friendly service from the staff who joked around and made us feel comfortable, very thoroughly ensuring me what options were halal, and which ones weren't. 98% of the menu is halal which is very reassuring and one of the surefire reasons I'll be back time and time again, not just for myself, but for my mom and dad when they come and visit. After all, finding a great steak, let alone halal of all things, is tough to find and they make a damn good one here.

Steve, our server for the night along with Iris, were very friendly. Steve was a true joy to have around, felt very genuine and made the night all the better.

For starters, the bread and pita combination was delicious. This is because they had a delicious jalapeno, lime juice, and I'm not sure what other mixed ingredient filled chutney that was very flavorful and made every bite a great free appetizer to start with.

We'd ordered the New York Steak which was more than filling and beautifully plated with cloves of garlic and delicious steak sauce that made every bite heaven for me. The salt rub added a delicious and additionally savory touch to every mouthful I could handle.

We'd also somehow found ourselves ordering 2 sides of potato dishes on top of the bed that we'd already had much to Steve's warning, but the potatoes were great.

Garlic mashed was tasty. The house potatoes under the steak were fantastic and delicious.

At the end, Steve told brought out a rasberry red velvet cake slice for my birthday treat which was the cherry on the top and really made the night all the more appreciated:

Thank you so much Arya Steakhouse, Steve, and Iris for the memorable and delicious experience! Food was amaaaaaazing!!! Me and my husband shared lamb chops and a ribeye steak. It came out with a roasted garlic and perfectly cooked potatoes. Everything was on point! And the best thing is they have halal meat!!! Very fancy and well decorated! I loved it!!!!!!We came last minute to celebrate my birthday and Mehdi was very helpful at explaining the menu. He also made great recommendations on what to eat! It was just beyond what I expected !!! Will be back very soon. Highly recommend this place especially for dinners for special occasions! Thank you Arya! I was visiting San Jose/Mountainview area and this steakhouse came up as halal! Now where I'm from, there's barely any halal steak so heck yeah I'm going to splurge and try it. It was an expensive meal regardless (not sure what I was expecting, it's steak and it's halal so they probably charge a premium for that). But it was really good! I sat outside. I didn't realize it came on country potatoes because I definitely got mash potatoes on the side. Is there such a thing as too much potato?? But the server was quite knowledgeable and very nice. Will come here if I ever get sent on a work trip again! Order #183410169725767

My order was accepted by the restaurant and confirmed for pick up between 8pm - 8:20pm. When I reached the restaurant at 8pm to pick my food the restaurant was closed.

I drove all the way from Saratoga Avenue in Santa Clara for over 40 minutes because this is the only steakhouse that serves Halal Steak.

It was my wedding anniversary and I had planned a surprise dinner for my wife. I had made all other arrangements but all my plans fell apart when I didn't get the food.

I am still in shock that something like this could actually happen! Order was received, accepted, confirmed and card charged by the restaurant when the restaurant was not even open!

I had placed the order at 4pm approximately and Grubhub had 4 hours to let me know if there was any issue with the order. In fact I received regular updates stating my order was in progress and when it was ready for pick up!

I have never been so disappointed. I spoke to Grubhub about their slip up and the position it put me in. They said they were sorry, offered me a 50% discount on my next order and simply cancelled my order. I received no formal communication regarding this from Grubhub after.

I don't know who is to blame here, the restaurant or GrubHub but it surely ruined my anniversary night. This is a long overdue review, now where do I start? I've been longing to visit Arya since I heard about it and the first time I went was with my entire family! I was a little scared since It was our first time and didn't know what it would be like. Arya turned out to exceed our expectations, this being such a high end steakhouse with halal options is a plus plus plus. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu, which made all our experiences a 10/10!

-I did go back recently and was extremely disappointed with the service and how the food turned out to be. I ordered myself a chicken plate and it did not turn out well. I did complain to our waiter, but he didn't really do anything about it. I took a couple of bites and left it: you can tell from pictures of how different the chicken looks from the first time and second time. Hopefully the next time we come, this doesn't happen. My husband ordered the tomahawk steak, which he loved! Amazing Food and amazing service. Their meet and chicken are very well flavored. I have tried their boneless chicken kabobs and boneless lamb kabobs both are so good. I would definitely recommend them. Also they serve Halal meet and chicken as well! Which is so convenient!! Partial Halal Menu. Ask for which steaks are Halal. Had the NY sirloin steak and it was great! Nice interiors and friendly service. Prices a little on the high side, but good to splurge once in awhile :) This was an amazing dining experience. My party and I were treated very kindly by the waitressing staff. Jennifer in particular was very helpful when it came to explaining the different flavors and cuts of the steaks. She helped us choose what would cater best for our personal palates as well as gave us a rundown of other menu items available that could go well with our desired steak. The steak I went with was the 8 oz filet mignon and it was absolutely delicious! I feel like I've never really enjoyed a good quality steak until visiting Arya. As a person who eats kosher and halal exclusively, this was a match made in heaven. Fine dining and absolutely brilliant flavor. The mashed potatoes were amazing. The chopped potatoes that were served beneath the steak were some of the best I've ever eaten, and it paired nicely with the roasted garlic and red sauce.

I will definitely be coming back again! It's a bit of a splurge if you get the steaks, but I think it's worth it. I'll be here dragging friends the next special occasion comes by. Hopefully I'll even be able to taste some dessert!

Also, shout out to Jennifer once again. Absolutely amazing waitress. A lot of quality restaurants tend to make you feel a little less homey and more like you're making a strict business venture when you're eating out. Jennifer made it feel like a welcoming atmosphere and it is obvious she forms good bonds with customers because some there greeted her like an old friend. I really enjoyed that.

It's safe to say this is my new steak place. And I definitely don't think any steak from BJs or some food chain will compare to Arya."
