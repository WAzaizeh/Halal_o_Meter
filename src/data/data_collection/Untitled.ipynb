Yes, In some way they have better tasting chicken than Halal Guys also their price is so affordable and food portion is very good for that price I paid. They have large menu to choose from and I tried the Chicken over Rice and I have to say that the best Chicken Over rice I have ever tasted. I also have tried their hot wings and they were very big in size. Definitely will go back every time I visit NYC.\",\n",

Upon, my first bite at home my mouth is on fire and the chicken is unchewable. Then I call Mia Halal to tell the story and get a response by saying...\" Sorry a different made the chicken....he probably left the chicken for too long\" and the women on the phone has the nerve to ask if I normally buy around this time because its a different guy! Avoid this place ..hit or miss and probably the most expensive in NY...Go Somewhere else.',\n",
       " \"Best Halal Food in Queens. No complaints about the food. Little more pricier than average, but it's worth it and you get more than enough rice and meat.\",\n",
       " \"Best halal food in queens, there are other great spots however they put the extra effort in adding more than just lettuce in the salad for the rice platters by adding cucumber, shredded carrots etc etc. The chicken over rice and lamb over rice is great, never greasy but full of flavor. This my go to halal food spot, their green sauce is amazing although it does come in a small packet.\\nAnother great thing they do is chop up the meat in small pieces whereas other halal carts usually give huge chunks of meat which isn't appetizing\",\n",
       " 'Mia Halal is probably one of the best halal food I ever had. I love how they serve the food. And they have very good customer service. The fact that they stay open until 5 in the morning is best thing. Perfect for late night cravings. It will be great if they get Ubereats for the store, so the customer can have the food delivered as well. The food is simply great, the texture of the meat and the softness of the rice is perfect.',\n",
       " 'Halal food is one of the most underrated cuisines on the planet. Usually halal food is packed with flavor but this was lacking. I ordered the lamb and chicken over rice and it wasnt ver good. The lamb meat was dry and had no taste. Even the yogurt sauce and hot sauce were bland. They had raw onions in the dish too which I have never seen. They need to cook those to take the sharpness out. Looks like they need to work out the kinks.',\n",
       " \"Best place for halal food in Queens.\\nEven late meals are great. Portions are good here. Flavor is amazing and the hot sauce is perfect. I recommend this to everyone!!!\\nI've been eating this on a daily basis and it even helped me lose weight\",\n",

       " 'Very good halal food. I had chicken over rice. I think it was $6.50. Lots of good flavors and ingredients in the rice including cilantro. Good sauces too; I had a few lines of their hot sauce which was flavorful. Definitely a filling portion. There is only seating for 8 in the restaurant. The food was ready very quickly - probably a minute or two wait. They accept credit cards.',\n",

       " 'I tend to prefer Halal carts as opposed to restaurants because most carts provide larger portions, which I like because I skip rice and bread to avoid carbs. I came to this spot because of the good reviews and my frequency in the neighborhood. Usually, a combo is split up with chicken and lamb served together, but separate from one another. Here, they chop it up together. The styrofoam cartons are a bit thin; so, the chicken/lamb portion is not that much without rice. I asked for $5 extra chicken and lamb, which they put in a separate small carton. What distinguishes this spot is the deep flavor of their spices. The chicken and lamb combo is absolutely great, and I was more than satisfied and completely full with the $5 extra. My only complaint is the limited parking, but I believe you can call in advance and pick-up quickly.',\n",
       " \"Typical halal cart. Good, cheap halal food that will do the job when you're hungry and in a hurry. Fairly clean, never seen unsanitary conditions when I am being served.\",\n",

       " \"I'm a NY'er, so by default... I love halal cart food. With that being said, I've tried many different carts and decided to give this storefront a try.\\n\\nThe food was good. The rice wasn't the traditional Basmati rice used in the carts, it was rather soft and complimented the food very well. The white sauce was tasty - not as flavorful as I expected.\\n\\nThe only reason I give this place 3 stars is for the mere fact that the service is slow. Parking is hard around this area and it takes about 15 minutes in total to order and get your food, 3x the time it takes at a cart. They're a bit more attentive to orders over the phone instead of serving the people at the counter.\\n\\nAlso, a chicken rice is about $7 and they tax you, so it's about $8-$10 depending on if you get a drink, and if you ask for extra white sauce to go, it's $.50 extra - not the kind of customer service that'll bring me back.\\n\\nOverall - the food was good, but not worth the hype or the wait... or the extra quarters. My local chicken and rice cart shall suffice, they're $4 cheaper and give extra sauce.\",\n",
       " \"Best halal food in NY. Period. Halal guys serve shredded chicken with no flavor. Four stars because only God creation is perfect. Bring back the biryani for VIPs. Oh and STOP charging for extra white sauce. Also, the guys in there are not rude, it's a takeout have you been to a NYC takeout before?? Chinese restaurant??\",\n",
       " \"Awesome halal food! Totally recommend it. Perfect temperature, flavor and serving size. People who work there are very nice and explain you if any question and give you good recommendations. It's not easy to find good places with a unique flavor.

       " \"I've been coming here for 5 years, I've been to MANY halal carts around Nyc and I love Mia for the quality of the chicken, the taste and the freshness. I've been to the Halal Guys and the only thing that makes them better is the rice, and white Sauce.\",\n",

I usually order the falafels and my guys the meats.  HANDS DOWN the best in NYC.  I've never had an issue w/their customer service.  They have always been very polite and quick.\",\n",
       " \"Highly recommend this place for halal food.\\n\\nI ordered the mix (chicken&lamb) with rice for $6.50. The portions are smaller than the other places but it is enough to fill you up.

       " 'Nothing fantastic, I prefer halal guys. Restaurant is not very clean and they have rediculous card fees!! It cost me $3 extra just to use my card :(. It took they guy about 7 mins to prepare the food but it was \"fresh\" no line and 4, 2 person tables so don\\'t plan on staying. The hot sauce is not hot at all so don\\'t get your hopes up if you\\'re looking for zing. I\\'m probably never going to come back for the distance I drove I can get way better halal at half the distance. I\\'m a little disappointed.',\n",
